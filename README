This is Arduino library for WiiRemote Bluetooth stack which supports minimum HCI and L2CAP layer for HID profile.

== First of all ==
This program is based on <wiiblue.pde> which is developed by Oleg Mazurov. This
program also needs MAX3421E and USB libraries for Arduino written by Oleg. The
source codes can be grabbed from <https://github.com/felis/USB_Host_Shield>.


== Hardware Requirement ==
    * Arduino
    * USB Host Shield
    * USB Bluetooth Device


== Software Requirement ==
    * MAX3421E and USB library for Arduino written by Oleg Mazurov


== GNU GPL ==
